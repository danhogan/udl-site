This month we have...

# [Power Rankings](/newsletter/2019/03/powerrankings.html)
# [Matchups To Watch](/newsletter/2019/03/matchups.html)

and a special look into each team's 2018 win total vs the age of their team:
# [Wins Vs Age](/newsletter/2019/03/winsvsage.html)

Also, if you have yet to see them, Darren of Preston Perennials gets a __huge__ shoutout for the owner interviews he's been doing. You can check it out in the ownersinterviews channel on the Slack, or I think I can link them here and have them only be viewable if you're logged into Slack:

# [Interview with Austin/Commish - The Gamblers](https://ultimatedynastyleague.slack.com/files/UCZSGGMK7/FH7TWSULB/austin_bristow_udl_league_owner_interview_-_24th_feb_2019.mp4)
# [Interview with Dan - Team Riptide](https://ultimatedynastyleague.slack.com/files/UCZSGGMK7/FGZA7QB25/dan_hogan_udl_league_owner_-_team_riptide_23rd_march_2019.mp4)

#### Final note:
If you have any desire to make silly posts like these or have any cool ideas, just let me know. Also, if you happen to have some coding skills, feel free to help me out or create whatever you want on this little website. The open source repo is [here](https://github.com/danhogan/udl-site).

That's it for now! Thanks for checking this out! Take the discussion to the Slack!
