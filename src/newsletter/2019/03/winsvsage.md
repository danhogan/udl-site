# Wins vs Age

I thought it might be fun to look at the average age of each roster as a loose estimation of who is trying to rebuild. Maybe. Rebuilding teams don't usually win as many games. Here's a scatter plot of each teams' 2018 wins vs average age of their roster as of the 19th when our rosters locked for week 1 (trades since then and the recent waiver draft/drops are not accounted for). You can hover over the dots to see what team each dot represents (sorry if this post isn't very mobile friendly).

Here's the same data in a table:

Remaining is the age distribution of each team. It's cool I guess. I think I'll let you all anaylze and discuss this on your own. I'm curious to know what you might think.
