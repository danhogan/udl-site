# March 2019 Power Rankings

### 1.  Riptide   
The reigning champ gets to be number one because I’m writing this and it might never happen again. Plus this baller Hoskins GIF needs to be at the top.

### 2. Hone Ron Runners
Mario’s squad had the most wins in the regular season of 2018 before getting bounced in the semifinals by the eventual champion. The Hone Ron Runners led the league in Runs, Strikeouts, and Quality Starts in 2018. They might have won some other categories too, but ESPN is having a fit on the 2018 season stats page.

### 3. Team !Ponche!
2018’s runner up also gave an extension Nolan Arenado (which was really relevant when I wrote this - before everyone and their cat got an extentsion.), so Team !Ponche! will probably still be pretty good. Plus Walker Buehler might just casually take Kershaw’s place on the Dodgers without the real life team skipping a beat. That bodes well for Team !Ponche!

### 4. Maine Cobra Kai
Cobra Kai finished 2018 with the second most wins before falling to the eventual champion in the first round of the playoffs. The squad is back and ready to trade itself to another playoff run in 2019.

### 5. Vengeful Tuna
Vengeful Tuna were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round of 2018. However, after maybe a little more time to “work on defense,” Vengeful Tuna will have Vladdy Jr. powering the squad. Some faces in new places on offense plus one of the strongest pitching staffs in the league put Vengeful Tuna in a position for success.

### 6. Discount Bob's Couch Emporium
Discount Bob's Couch Emporium were also knocked out of the playoffs in the first round of 2018. Though they may sound like an unintimidating ska band, Discount Bob’s squad is stacked. Yu Darvish could reemerge as an ace faster than Trevor Bauer can shut him down on Twitter. Daniel Murphy is ready to rake in Colorado and the reigning NL MVP in Christian Yelich is back to do damage. That’s all before getting to the much-talked-about Machado and 2018 World Series MVP Steve Pearce!

### 7. The Gamblers
The Commish is back and is bringing Judgement to us all. If we just ignore Benintendi’s second half like the rest of the internet, The Gamblers are looking pretty good! Like a good member of the Pitcher List crew, the Commish also employs Luis Castillo. This is his year! #HunterPence4MVP

![luis-castillo](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/8/7/6/282518876/062218_CIN_Castillo_Fist_Pump.gif)
### 8. Bringers of W.A.R.
Bringers of W.A.R. rounds out the group of 2018 playoff contenders. The Bringers also fell in the first round last year. If only there was a Vladdy Daddy to save him. Just kidding, the real daddy (Mike Trout) is already bringing W.A.R. This squad led the league in stolen bases last year and with the continued emergence of German Marquez could become a real threat.

### 9. Back2Back Jax
Back2Back Jax was just slightly edged out of the playoffs. The squad offers a strong lineup alongside the two-headed monster of Scherzer and Sale that could easily move themselves up this list. Once Bartolo Colon signs with a team, Back2Back Jax is a real threat! Wait - Nevermind. He dropped him since I started writing this. Back2Back Jax is in trouble now.

![scherzer](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/8/4/2/284521842/070618_gif_wsh_scherzer_reaction_mid.gif)
### 10. Torrano Beisbol Birds
Jose Ramirez and Bryce Harper lead a very solid lineup. Is Miguel Cabrera still alive? If so, the rest of us are in trouble! Carlos Correa might be a stud again and Danny Jansen is going to be a stud (please give him back :(...). Also… BIG BOY ELOY is coming!

![jose-ramirez](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/2/3/0/296699230/093018_CLE_Ramirez_Hand_Signals.gif)
### 11. Forgot About Trea
Nationals manager Dave Martinez certainly didn’t forget about Trea. Trea Turner and Whit Merrifield will keep Forgot About Trea ahead in steals. A strong sophomore season from Juan Soto combined with a healthy Kris Bryant could make Forgot About Trea a real threat. Maybe Byron Buxton will even decide to join the party! Zack Wheeler is looking good after a strong finish to 2018 and there are plenty of other possible pitching breakouts on this squad as well.

![trea-turner](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/6/2/6/286858626/072218_gif_trea_turner_face_med.gif)
### 12. Big League Chu
Michael Brantley is going to rake in Houston and David Dahl..? David Dahl! If the Rays pitching staff figures itself out, Big League Chu will be in solid shape as 2018 AL Cy Young winner Blake Snell leads the charge.

![blake-snell](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/9/3/8/302127938/122118_xmas_tb_snell.gif)
### 13. Preston Perennials
The team from down under might rise up and cause some surprise in 2019. J.T. Realmuto is in a park where players can actually hit, Rafael Devers keeps getting slept on, and Max Muncy let’s have some Funcy! Thor and the Biebs could be a fun one-two to lead the rotation. Before you know it, the Forrest may also appear from among the trees.

![shane-bieber](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/3/6/2/291313362/082118_cle_bieber_clapping.gif)
### 14. Springfield Isotopes
The Isotopes led the league in RBI in 2018. That solid lineup is back and if a few pitchers throw up to their potential, the Springfield Isotopes are a force to be reckoned with.

![javier-baez](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/7/1/6/300904716/111918_baez_stink_face.gif)
### 15. Boston Narb Sluggers
Jake Bauers was worth being traded for. Yoan Moncada could finally hit his potential. Ian Happ could hit his potential. Jose Peraza could hit his potential on a revamped team. Nimmo, Conforto, Laureano, oh my! If Alex Reyes gets to start and Nick Pivetta lives up to some of the hype, there’s not a chance this team finishes last in the league again. Not even close.

![michael-conforto](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/1/1/2/294511112/091318_gif_nym_conforto_clapping.gif)
### 16. Acuna Matata
Corey Seager is back and Ronnie Acuna is going to be drafted before Mike Trout next year (:-o). Hopefully Severino is alright.

![ronald-acuna](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/6/8/0/300428680/110818_atl_acuna.gif)
### 17. The Royal Rooters
There’s some young talent on this squad to go with Alex Bregman including Nick Senzel and Fernie Tats Jr. The future is bright.

![alex-bregman](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/6/5/0/297421650/100818_bregamn_reporter_stare.gif)
### 18. Havana Pigs
There are certainly some bats in the lineup, including a Betts bat. Maybe Robbie Ray will put it all together and lead the Pigs on a run.

![mookie](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/4/4/6/304888446/030719_mookie_wave.gif)
### 19. Wayne’s Hardware
A healthy Michael Fulmer (oh no, I wrote this too early I'm sorry) and a Julio Urias that’s allowed to play could do well in support of ace Gerrit Cole. Vogelbach, please save this team!

![vogelbach](http://mlb.mlb.com/images/7/2/4/218251724/vogelback_nodding_med_hkj42cf5.gif)
### 20. Cat Scratch Fever
What’s more than one key? Touki. And hey! Ozzie Albies!
