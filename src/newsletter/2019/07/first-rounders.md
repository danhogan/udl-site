It has been nearly three years since the UDL held its inaugural draft. Here's a look back on who was taken in the first round.

## 1. Mike Trout - Bringers of W.A.R.
Since start of 2017: .306/.450/.639, 271 runs, 105 home runs, 231 RBI, 54 stolen bases

Congrats to the former owner of Bringers of W.A.R. on not messing up.

## 2. Mookie Betts - Havana Pigs (Now Mookie and the Betts)
Since start of 2017: .296/.389/.524, 319 runs, 71 home runs, 229 RBI, 68 stolen bases
![betts](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://calltothepen.com/wp-content/uploads/getty-images/2017/07/958838490.jpeg&c=sc&w=3200&h=2133)
Probably the right pick at #2.

## 3. Bryce Harper - The Amazins (Now Toranno Beisbol Birds)
Since start of 2017: .273/.392/.520, 255 runs, 80 home runs, 257 RBI, 22 stolen bases
![harper](https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_10682942_1.2e16d0ba.fill-735x490.jpg)
Not a bad pick. Especially 3 years ago for a dynasty league.

## 4. Kris Bryant - Big League Choo (Now Forgot about Trea)
Since start of 2017: .289/.398/.519, 248 runs, 62 home runs, 174 RBI, 11 stolen bases
![bryant](https://media.nbcchicago.com/images/652*367/GettyImages-1157608960.jpg)
Bryant's had some ups and downs, but drafting a young MVP is hard to fault.

## 5. Jose Altuve - Darkness Falls (Now Wayne's Hardware)
Since start of 2017: .322/.387/.500, 237 runs, 51 home runs, 178 RBI, 53 stolen bases
![altuve](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwaGmzb1uOB9X1PdVLZkrJLiTlA=/0x0:3902x2601/1200x800/filters:focal(1639x989:2263x1613)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59241527/874156834.jpg.0.jpg)
A 5-category stud who won MVP the year after being drafted. Solid pick.

## 6. Manny Machado - Edwin Parrot (Now Discount Bob's Couch Emporium)
Since start of 2017: .275/.339/.506, 222 runs, 95 home runs, 268 RBI, 26 stolen bases
![machado](https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/marquee_large_2x/public/2017/12/14/manny-machado-trade-rumors.jpg?itok=gC3cvLyB)
It was a rough 2017 by Machado's own standards, but he's bounced back some. Can't fault the pick here at all.

## 7. Nolan Arenado - !Ponche!
Since start of 2017: .303/.373/.568, 267 runs, 97 home runs, 316 RBI, 7 stolen bases
![arendao](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-s3.si.com%2Fstyles%2Fmarquee_large_2x%2Fs3%2Fimages%2Fnolan-arenado-1300.jpg%3Fitok%3DHzq3-P4P&w=1000&q=70)
COORS. But yeah... Good pick.

## 8. Xander Bogaerts - Maine BullMoose (Now Big League Chu)
Since start of 2017: .289/.364/.487, 244 runs, 54 home runs, 241 RBI, 26 stolen bases
![bogaerts](https://nesncom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/xander-bogaerts-10.jpg)
A very risky pick back at the end of 2016. After a so-so 2017, he's turned out to be a pretty solid shortstop. I guess it worked out.

## 9.Carlos Correa - Rubber Ducks (Now Springfield Isotopes)
Since start of 2017: .281/.358/.492, 168 runs, 50 home runs, 184 RBI, 6 stolen bases
![correa](https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/803517366.jpg?w=610&h=343&crop=1)
A pretty risky pick taking such a youngin'. Unfortunately injuries have hurt a bit, but he proves mostly solid when on the field.

## 10. Clayton Kershaw - Yogi Bears (Now Vengeful Tuna)
Since start of 2017: 2.60 ERA, 0.999 WHIP, 465 strikeouts, 447.1 innings
![kershaw](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-s3.si.com%2Fs3fs-public%2Fstyles%2Fmarquee_large_2x%2Fpublic%2F2019%2F04%2F16%2Fclayton-kershaw-first-start-2019.jpg%3Fitok%3DI7HGTUqA&w=1000&q=70)
The first pitcher off the board. Hard to fault taking the shot at a generational pitcher with pick #10.

## 11. Alex Bregman - Operation Rot Storm (Now Royal Rooters)
Since start of 2017: .280/.380/.510, 266 runs, 76 home runs, 237 RBI, 31 stolen bases
![bregman](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/01/60/75/17239874/3/420x0.jpg)
A recklessly risky pick that raised some eyebrows at the end of 2016. Luckily it has mostly worked out for the Breg man.

## 12. Paul Goldschmidt - Mean Machine (Now Preston Perennials)
Since start of 2017: .283/.382/.522, 273 runs, 90 home runs, 255 RBI, 25 stolen bases
![goldy](https://lwosonbaseball.ms.lastwordonsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/852624328.jpg)
Solid pick. We'll see if he can continue turning it around this year.

## 13. Anthony Rizzo - Barrons (Now Cat Scratch Fever)
Since start of 2017: .281/.387/.498, 239 runs, 77 home runs, 279 RBI, 20 stolen bases
![rizzo](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6eutD7a-FIg7GRCIf2M5B5Idws=/0x0:4000x2667/1200x800/filters:focal(0x0:4000x2667)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/38666946/20140803_gav_sv5_003.jpg.0.jpg)
Finished 4th in MVP voting in 2016. Really not a bad pick.

## 14. Josh Donaldson - Back2Back Jax
Since start of 2017: .261/.375/.523, 153 runs, 64 home runs, 161 RBI, 7 stolen bases
![donaldson](https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DONALSDON_FEATURED-IMAGE-1040x572.jpg)
Injuries obviously haven't helped, but in 2016 he was coming off an MVP season and having another great year. A fair pick for sure.

## 15. Corey Seager - Strikeout for Harambe (Now Acuna Matata)
Since start of 2017: .286/.367/.460, 142 runs, 32 home runs, 132 RBI, 5 stolen bases
![corey-seager](https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/97c231f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/840x473!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fca-times.brightspotcdn.com%2F24%2F85%2F50355ff4740338914117a6a960f1%2Fla-1562803605-bz0zjlu9nt-snap-image)
Another bite from the injury bug. He was drafted as a 22-year-old winning ROY and finishing third in MVP voting. Hopefully he can avoid further injuries.

## 16. Edwin Encarnacion - Hone Ron Runners
Since start of 2017: .246/.352/.497, 240 runs, 100 home runs, 286 RBI, 5 stolen bases
![e5](http://www.gammonsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edwin-Encarnacion.jpg)
Now with 8 straight seasons of 30+ homers, this was the first case of everyone looking at the young "dynasty studs" while Mario is doing smart things.

## 17. Trevor Story - Cobra Kai
Since start of 2017: .272/.335/.527, 230 runs, 83 home runs, 248 RBI, 47 stolen bases
![story](https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0613/r556044_600x400_3-2.jpg)
Was relatively risky at the time, but he's turned out to be the 5-category-stud of Coors.

## 18. DJ Peterson (Compensation) - Rockers (Now Boston Narb Sluggers)
D.J. Peterson has yet to reach the majors.
![fernandez](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2016/09/25/ap_13060818207-10bba44d3f70c079096e1b7600498ed8810bcf7f-s800-c85.jpg)
As some may recall, the real pick here was Jose Fernandez. He was selected in the UDL draft exactly one month before his tragic death. Rest in peace, Jose.

## 19. Giancarlo Stanton - Riptide
Since start of 2017: .274/.361/.565, 229 runs, 98 home runs, 239 RBI, 7 stolen bases
![stanton](https://homerundaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DKB170803021_Marlins_at_Braves-.jpg)
The MVP season of 2017 with 59 bombs made this pick look pretty good. You be the judge on my own pick.

## 20. Starling Marte
Since start of 2017: .280/.329/.453, 195 runs, 44 home runs, 162 RBI, 67 stolen bases
![marte](https://radioimg.s3.amazonaws.com/kdkafm/styles/nts_image_cover_tall_775x425/s3/USATSI_12651326.jpg?ot6x52CTOppqXOOCQg38E_oKGfWOiEqK&itok=SadsE03a&c=284efe62d2d2b2a73fa06cf3a9b313b0)
A PED suspension in 2017 wasn't great. He still has the most stolen bases in this first round except for falling one bag behind Mookie.
