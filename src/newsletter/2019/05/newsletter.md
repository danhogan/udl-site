Welcome to the summer!

## UDL Player of the Month - Rafael Devers - Preston Perennials
![devers](/devers-edited.jpg)
The UDL player of the month will be awarded to someone that has exceeded expectation, surprised, and belongs to a UDL team with a unique logo &#128513;. This player will then be subject to my subpar photoshop skills. If you want help with a logo, ask me or whoever it was that had the generator thing.

This month brings more goodies:
