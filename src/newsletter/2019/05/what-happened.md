# What Ever Happened to Him?
**by Brandon H (Maine Cobra Kai)**

I was thinking, what ever happened to that guy who was supposed to be so good that he was a canâ€™t miss guy. Here is a list of a few names you might remember about and laugh.

### Brady Aiken
He was supposed to be the high school kid that was going to tear everything thing up. Well he did tear things like a Tommy John surgery very early in his career. He was picked 17 overall in 2015. He finally did pitch this year in single-A at 22 years old. He pitched 2/3 of an inning and gave up 6 walks, 1 K, and 3 runs. Yes that gave him a 40.50 ERA and 10.50 whip. I know he is young so he might turn it around but he has a VERY long ways to go. Oh ya he was picked 1st overall back in 2014 but refused to sign.

### Mark Apple
He was another number 1 overall pick back in 2013. He did pitch very little in the majors and his last season in AAA back in 2017 was a 5.27 ERA, 1.76 WHIP, and 60/53 K/BB ratio in 82 innings. He stepped down from baseball and said he would take a break from it. That was over 2 years ago. Maybe he will be back maybe not. 

### Jacob Nottingham
He was supposed to be the next Buster Posey. He could do it all. I bought into him too. I picked him up thinking this guy will solve my catcher problem for the next 10 years. He has been in the minors forever and was called up a few times. He never developed into that all-star catcher. 

### Hunter Harvey
He was supposed to be the big stud for Baltimore but never really had a chance with injuries. He is doing okay in AA but nothing special.
