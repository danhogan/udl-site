# Survey Results

Remember when we had a survey? Well fourteen of you took the time to take it. Here are the results of what you were thinking back in late February/early March.

## Who will make the most trades during the 2020 season?

6 out of 14 went with Mario and the Hone Ron Runners on this one. Preston Perennials and Beanetown Cruz Line also each had two votes and were the only others with more than one.

## Who will attend the most live MLB games this season?

Hone Ron Runners snagged 12 out of 14 on this one with Team Hooth and Torrano Beisbol Birds each received a vote. Good luck with that one now!

## Who has the best team logo?

This was a split with 3 votes going to both of The Gamblers and Torrano Beisbol Birds. I guess our league has a thing for Microsoft Paint. The only other team with more than one vote was Beanetown Cruz Line with two because why not? Boats are sweet.

## Who will improve most over last years' standings?

This was another split of 3 votes apiece going to Beanetown Cruz Line and Torrano Beisbol Birds. Springfield Isotopes, Cat Scratch Fever, and The Royal Rooters (who have had an owner change since this survey) each received two votes.

## Who will win the 2020 UDL Championship?

Five different team found 2 votes apiece here: Team Hooth, The Gamblers, Torrano Beisbol Birds, Back2Back Jax, and Beanetown Cruz Line. A fair bit has changed over the last 5 months. Who will take it home in roto?

## Who is the UDL 2020 Dark Horse?

Preston Perennials received 4 votes here while Springfield Isotopes and Forgot About Trea each received two.

## Who will win the World Series in 2020?

Mookie Betts and the Dodgers won this one with 7 votes while 4 of you chose the Yankees. Receiving one vote apiece were the Athletics, the Braves, and the Angels.
